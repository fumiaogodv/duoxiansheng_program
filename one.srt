1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,159
what's up everyone I'm AJ Brown and I'm

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,679
here to show you how to train like an

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,200
NFL wide receiver for the Super Bowl

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,200
long down the left side ground right in

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,000
the pocket he's got a 38 yd

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,240
completion at the age of 15 I started

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,320
working out I wasn't too fun of it but

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,600
you know I started started doing it and

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,800
as I got older and I grew it became

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,560
fun the advice that stuck with me is

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,000
from my trainer today uh Joey Gario and

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,480
that goes back into saying uh doing that

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,360
one extra rep but to really train

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
yourself you know don't just do the rep

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
um in the waight room just cuz it's what

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,320
it says No actually that's that's your

17
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,239
game time moment and so you need to lock

18
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,000
in and you know put everything you have

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,640
in these moments and and so you can try

20
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,399
to get the the max ability and step out

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,800
on the

22
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,879
field we're going to start with Kaa

23
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,680
power squats four sets three reps

24
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,079
[Music]

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,760
I'm trying to be explosive as I can here

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,000
in this video so he can translate on the

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,640
field with me coming off the ball and

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,520
just really just running you know uh

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,550
working my lower body legs

30
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,159
[Music]

31
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,200
glutes as a receiver the most important

32
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,360
muscle group I would definitely say the

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,840
lower body the glutes the handam me the

34
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,280
quads the ankle Mobility I want to say

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,880
really from your waist down because so

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,439
much goes into it and you're running

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,520
you're cutting you're putting your foot

38
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,360
in the ground you're stopping you're

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,720
starting you're running as fast as

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,560
possible and you stopping as fast as

41
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,360
possible so the lower body is so

42
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,119
important and you have to take care of

43
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:42,479
and you have to train really well next

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,600
up hamstring rotation three sets five

45
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
reps here is just really simple just

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,119
trying to work on the hamstring

47
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,560
flexibility lower body upper body uh

48
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,479
flexibility that just translate with

49
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,280
everything because without my hamstrings

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,880
and I can't do anything so

51
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,680
[Music]

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,119
next up we got kaer anti rotation press

53
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,039
three sets eight

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,640
reps it's just really self-explanatory

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,800
just just a press you know uh working

56
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,120
upper body that movement you know that

57
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,640
translate with me when I'm blocking get

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,519
my hands on guys and you know driving

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,120
them off the

60
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,040
ball I like to box a lot it helps on the

61
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,720
football field it translate because of

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,319
the cardio I do in the boxing I do it

63
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,840
for one that I fell in love with the

64
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,920
sport but also that I never get tired

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,800
it's just another way of I can do cardio

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,280
without putting a lot of stress on my

67
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,560
joints and you know just to stay

68
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
active next up is dumbbell bench press

69
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,560
four set five reps you can increase the

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,000
weight if you want to now I I do I kind

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,200
of get carried away actually cuz you

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,000
know I like to look good you know uh but

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,920
it it translate on the field with with

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,440
everything with hand fighting at the

75
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,480
line of scrimmage or me me just being

76
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,560
physical in between my routes and you

77
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,840
know making sure I have the room to

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,640
catch the ball fighting off guys it's

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,239
just that's

80
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,319
everything I don't have a favorite body

81
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,080
part to work out but I would say just

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,599
upper body you know I'm big strong I

83
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,799
like to look good you know feel good and

84
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,640
you know uh intimidate people

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,000
so next up hip thrust three sets of

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,319
eight

87
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,280
reps it's one of my favorite exercises

88
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
because it helps out with everything you

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,439
know we can't run unless our glutes are

90
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:35,080
firing and we most definitely We Can't

91
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,200
Stop without our glutes are firing so

92
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,799
that's just something that I'm trying to

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,720
strengthen and and make sure I can be

94
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
explosive that goes into the explosive

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
category that I do on a

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,200
daily me and Devonte workout is is

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,239
different but kind of similar in some

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,840
ways he may go lighter and sometimes I

99
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,239
go lighter and sometimes I go heavier

100
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,560
but as the season progress we all tend

101
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,680
to lower our weight because it's just

102
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,480
not smart thing to do and you have to

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
learn to manage that and I feel like we

104
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,040
have have done a great job in the weight

105
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,519
room to manage what what works best for

106
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,239
us next up single leg extensions three

107
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,480
sets of eight

108
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,840
reps one of my favorites that I like to

109
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,959
add in to make sure everything is is

110
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,320
working accordingly um my lower half so

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,079
it's really quad dominant and making

112
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,560
sure my quad is strong because my quad

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,080
is strong and my knee is good and it it

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,759
goes all the way down to my ankor so

115
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,560
everything works up everything's in a

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,440
straight line and that is a target area

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,360
that I'm going to focus because I have

118
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,430
to stop at full speed and these are my

119
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,160
[Music]

120
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,759
brakes next up ker Bell swings we got

121
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,680
four sets of six

122
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,960
reps I like to go heavy on these

123
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
extremely

124
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,479
heavy working glutes hammies again this

125
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,360
is something I'm going to keep targeting

126
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
because as a receiver I'm running I'm

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,240
stopping and and it's again it's one of

128
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,600
my favorite exercises cuz it's real

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,039
simple to do real easy and uh I can go

130
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,560
as heavy as I want to and you know but

131
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,840
make sure you do it correctly cuz you

132
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,970
don't want back

133
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:20,699
[Music]

134
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,840
PRS that's what it looks like to train

135
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,560
like an NFL wide receiver for the Super

136
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Bowl I hope this helps the next time you

137
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,639
get in the gym
